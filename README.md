# Consensus Income Analysis

## Overview
This project was created as a part of a hackathon where I participated in a data analytics competition. The goal was to analyze income data and build a model to predict income levels based on various demographic factors.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately predict income levels based on demographic features such as age, education, occupation, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Census Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains demographic information about individuals such as age, education, marital status, occupation, etc., and the corresponding income levels (whether income exceeds $50K/year or not).

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Standardized numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explored the relationships between different features and income levels.
   - Visualized the distribution of various features.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Tried various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation.
   - Evaluated models based on accuracy and F1-score.

## Results
- Secured **2nd** position in the hackathon.

## Dependencies
- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Consensus_Income_Analysis.ipynb`.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the factors affecting income levels and demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting income based on demographic data.
