# Consensus Income Analysis

## Overview
This project was created as a part of a hackathon where I participated in a data analytics competition. The goal was to analyze income data based on various demographic factors.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to analyse and visualise income levels based on demographic features such as age, education, occupation, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was provided by the organizers of the hackathon.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Standardized numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explored the relationships between different features and income levels.
   - Visualized the distribution of various features.
     
3. **Power BI Report:** 

## Results
- Secured **2nd** position in the hackathon.

## Dependencies
- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Consensus_Income_Analysis.ipynb`.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the factors affecting income levels and demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting income based on demographic data.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to the organizers of the hackathon for providing the opportunity to work on this project.
